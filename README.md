Scrolling.js
=====================

A small framework to facilitate scrolling sites. Essentially several events to hook into, and properties to query, in your own script.

Also includes debug overlay for live reporting of current positions of elements.

No dependencies except for jQuery in old IE browsers, used for Sizzle. Tested in IE7+, Chrome and Firefox.
